# Collective - A Better Economy
Collective aims to enable the creation of communities free of private ownership of production, one where labor is freely assigned and one whose work is the only investment possible.

Goods and Services are not directly offered by other members of the community, instead, they are offered by Descentralized Autonomous Organizations, DAOs, through Contracts.

Inside Collective, all resources are owned by the community and DAOs are established based on the demands of this community. To fulfill a contract a DAO will establish Tasks and Resources needed, and Tasks are fulfilled by the members of the community.

Every time a Task is fulfilled, it will pay the amount specified in the Contract to the Worker, and the same amount in Tokens for that particular DAO. These Tokens will later be used as "voting power" when decisions need to be made in the DAO. An optional delegation system can be used by a Worker to cast votes as another Worker.

To ensure the worker can execute a given Task, a Skill system was thought, where Tasks establish requirements and Workers are assessed by Bodies of Knowledge, specially designed DAOs that are responsible for Training, Improvement and Assessment of the Community Knowledge.

In the heart of the community lies the Common Fund, a particular DAO responsible for funding Tasks in other DAOs. Since DAOs have no ownership and cannot profit, all direct funding of a DAO will work as donations. There are many ways in which the Common Fund can have a solid reserve, it is always opened for donations, it can charge interest on the funding and require repayment and last but not least, it can Tax the system, either through fees collected on transactions or imposing a mandatory "Resource" on every Contract. 

Tokens are not transferable, so they cannot be inherited or sold. The funds gathered through wage are transferable, and can be accumulated, which still stratifies society, but concentrates this more in lifestyles and their resource consumption. 

## The Community

## The Worker

### Skills

## The DAO
The symbol of the Means of Production, the assembly of human talent and work into forces of transformation.

### Bodies of Knowledge
Cooks, Plumbers, Carpenteers and so on ... the Bodies of Knowledge represents the Intangible Human Knowledge on the different fields, and also supervises (or manage) the Training, Research and Assessment. Most importantly is that a Body of Knowledge Regulates its field.

### The Common Fund
Basically a public Bank, but it can operate differently than a pure interest based system. 

### Society
The Community itself can be organized in a DAO, and operate through Direct Democracy. Given that most of the regulatory weight is delegated to Bodies of Knowledge, Elections are held less frequently and Decisions are narrowed to specific details of Social Engagement. Another way of minimizing Decisions is to establish a Hierarchy where Locally affecting decisions are taken only by members of that locality.

## The Contract
The goal of a Contract is to provide a Product, either a Good or a Service. Products may be used as resources by other Contracts as well as consumed directly by the Community Members.

It has a two main components Resources Needed and Tasks Required. The Contract will also establish additional details regarding how much Product must be kept in stock if the concept is applicable, and minimum ammount of Resource needed for production.

Finally, Products have a Value, which needs to be provided so it can be used. This Value can be determined by the Weight of each Task and Resource needed. 

### Tasks
These are the Work Assignments in the Community, and the name represents two concepts, one is the Class, the set of shared characteristics and the other is the Instance, the specific demand for a task to be executed. Tasks define how much Value is awarded for an Hour of work, what is to be done, which Skills are required and details specific to it such as estimated effort and quality assurance. Specific instances will establish how much work is needed and when it needs to be done (including flexible ranges and also in some cases availability of Resources).

### Resources
Anything that isn't direct work is a Resource, even services provided by other DAOs. The important distinction comes to the most basic Resources, Natural Resources, such as Land, Water and so on. They are all managed by the Community, that establishes its Value and regulates its usage, all funds are collected by the Common Fund.

## Technical Specification

Alright, How? By the usage of Contracts and DAOs its awful clear that this has something to do with Blockchain. Yes, that is correct, but right now I have no idea on how to make that happen.

Also, there are a few UIs needed for interaction with the system, and some really good WitchCraft to make a decent Contract/Task modeller for non-tech folks to be able to break down Economic segments into DAOs and Contracts.

There is no need for this to run on an existing CryptoCoin, it could certainly operate on a different coin in a more closed system, the Common Fund also operating as the Reserve and giving monetary foundation to the Community. Also, Mining is not technically needed, neither is Proof of Work, the most important trait of the Blockchain is the Consensus Mechanism and if some low energy alternative is available, it should be considered.

There is no need for this to run Universally from day one, it can be built to work on premise, and the design allows for easy merging of communities.
