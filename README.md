# Collective - A Better Economy
Collective aims to enable the creation of communities free of private ownership, one where labor is freely assigned and one whose work is the only investment possible. 

Goods and Services are not directly offered by other members of the community, instead, they are offered by Descentralized Autonomous Organizations, DAOs, through Contracts.

Inside Collective, all resources are owned by the Community and DAOs are established based on the Demands of this Community. To fulfill a contract, a DAO will establish a set of Tasks and Resources needed. Tasks are fulfilled by the Members of the Community.

Every time a Task is fulfilled, it will pay the amount specified in the Contract to the Worker, and the same amount in Tokens for that particular DAO. These Tokens will later be used as "voting power" when decisions need to be made in the DAO. An optional delegation system can be used by a Worker to cast votes as another Worker.

To ensure the worker can execute a given Task, a Skill system was thought, where Tasks establish requirements and Workers are assessed by Bodies of Knowledge, specially designed DAOs that are responsible for Training, Improvement and Assessment of the Community Knowledge.

In the heart of the community lies the Common Fund, a particular DAO responsible for funding Tasks in other DAOs. Since DAOs have no ownership and cannot profit, all direct funding of a DAO will work as donations. There are many ways in which the Common Fund can have a solid reserve, it is always opened for donations, it can charge interest on the funding and require repayment and last but not least, it can Tax the system, either through fees collected on transactions or imposing a mandatory "Resource" on every Contract. 

Tokens are not transferable, so they cannot be inherited or sold. The funds gathered through wage are transferable, and can be accumulated, which still stratifies society, but concentrates this more in lifestyles and their resource consumption. 

## The Community
This term will be referenced all over this text, and usually as a source of authority. It consists of all of those registered in the system (as in a particular instance of Collective, but also a potential unified global system) and it represents the whole, being as such, the sole owner of resources available. This strict ownership doesn't mean nobody can access or use resources, but rather that its usage is governed by the People.

Very little impositions are made, and so nothing directs how Communities are managed, except themselves. The prime rule is that nobody is required to be part or stay in a Community and that all its members should have representativeness.

To allow integration with non-Collective systems, Goods and Services may be sold to non-members and also Resources may be acquired from external entities. The Common Fund is used for the monetary aspect.

## The Worker
The members of the community can be called by any name, but I rather stick with Worker. It receives a Unique pair of Keys, a Public one, and a Private, the Public is used as his Wallet, or Checkings Account, it identifies him on transactions happening and the private to authorize any movements from his Wallet. This is a very sensitive part of the system as Private Keys must be kept in secret but also, can't be lost otherwise the account is permanently locked.

Workers not only have Value obtained from Tasks completed but also Tokens from all DAOs he worked with. DAOs may have additional information regarding a Worker, such as Reviews from Tasks executed or other issues identified. In order to take Tasks, Workers have to show that they have the required Skills. The certification process is controlled by a DAO that regulates a group of activities, the Body of Knowledge.

Each Worker has a Balance, which is the sum of all Value he has obtained minus all Contracts he has consumed, it can be positive or negative and is unbounded (see The Common Fund for the How). If thought carefully, the Balance has very little importance except as to be kept positive symbolizing you are helping the Community thrive, since is the Community itself that decides the Value of the Work (through the DAOs) and therefore its importance.

Finally, since a Worker can only consume from a DAO, there is no direct transfer of Value, and given the lack of private onwership, there is no inheritance in the system. Even though families still exist, the economic aspect is removed from it, leaving only the bonds and human aspects.

### Demands
In a Free Market system, the Supply reacts to the Demand, but it has elements that allow this to offset, such as Marketing on the Demand side and Intentional Scarcicity in the Supply. On the Price Competition aspect is where Wage Supression happens, estimulating the Owner to achieve competitiveness not through inovation but through lower Wages.

Since Collective removes ownership from the system, the DAO cannot suppress Wage since it's controlled by the Workers themselves, and Tasks that are seen as unworthy will not find Workers and in result, the DAO won't be able to meet the Demand and will either improve its Contracts or cease to exist and be replaced by another.

Demand is the central piece of the system as it shapes the purpose of the Community and is the objective measure of its Values, most Communities start by satisfying the most basic needs and will grow from there, and then new needs will come. The tendency is that Resources that require Innovation, Creativity or very long Work Chains from the raw materials to the final Product (like airplanes) will have a higher Value associated, and as such, Workers that fulfill such Tasks will receive more Value for their Work, but not only the expenses needed to achieve such capability are higher but also the dedication needed, therefore stabilizing Balances across Workers.

### Skills
Skills are a way of establishing requirements for the execution of a Task, such as knowing how to Cook to take a Cooking Task for a DAO Restaurant. It's the job of the Bodies of Knowledge to decide the granularity and specificity of skills, or how they relate with each other.

## The DAO
These organizations represent modern day Companies, except that they are public owned and governed by those that have worked on it. The foundation of a DAO requires an effort that grants its founders Tokens and as such, power over it, but unless they do all the work, this power will dilute as the business expands.

1) DAO Balance - Since the Value gathering through Products being consumed and the spending through Resources and Tasks is not synchronized, the DAO also has a Balance and it mostly can be Negative (only the stock effect may create positive Balance, but I'm not sure if that happens for other reasons and if it can grow indefinetly) but is bounded.

2) DAO Creation - The problem here is how to decide which DAOs should be created. The Community may have to decide and maybe, one way is to have a Criteria to be met depending on the Resource being requested, so if a very scarce Resource is required, the DAO is required to have a particular number of future consumers before it's allowed to operate.

Also, when one or more Workers create a DAO, they receive Founder Tokens, a symbolic name given to the Tokens awarded to them that gives them equal share of the DAO (for Voting). 

### Bodies of Knowledge
Cooks, Plumbers, Carpenteers and so on ... the Bodies of Knowledge represents the Intangible Human Knowledge on the different fields, and also supervises (or manage) the Training, Research and Assessment. Most importantly is that a Body of Knowledge Regulates its field and defines the Skill Set of that field.

### The Common Fund
Basically a public Bank, but it operates differently than one would in a profit oriented system. Its most important role is incubating DAOs, since the initial investment involved is high and it takes time for it to start repaying, and in order to do so, DAOs borrow Value to pay for Resources and Tasks. He is also the mediator of external transactions, holding funds (in multiple possible ways, prefereably with liquidity, and in lightly regulated and taxed mediums, potentially other crypto currencies) and receiving funds (as payments or donations) and paying for external Resources. It's possible to implement Collective with the Common Fund offering credit to individuals, but that is not needed if Society DAO (see below) acts as a Welfare agent, which is similar to proposals such as Universal Basic Income.

Another approach is for the Comon Fund to act only as the mediator with the external World, not having much influence in the operation of the Community. To solve the DAO Incubation problem, Collective would allow Negative Balance in a Wallet, basically, remove in the Blockchain Transaction Processing the notion that Alice cannot give a coin she doesn't have to Bob. This sounds crazy when seen in that way, but freezing time, that's basically Alice using a credit card. In this approach, Value is an internal measure for the Community, when a Worker has a Healthy Balance, it means he has done more for the Community than he has taken, having Negative Balance doesn't necesserely means a bad actor, as it can represent someone that has permanent or temporary disability, but it certanly can be used to detect and early approach Workers that are not contributing. I particularly like this approach, but it probably requires designing a new coin (which is maybe the best way to go, forking Ethereum to start with).

### Society
The Community itself can be socially organized in a DAO, and operate through Direct Democracy. Given that most of the regulatory weight is delegated to Bodies of Knowledge, Elections are held less frequently and Decisions are narrowed to specific details of Social Engagement and Resource Access Protection. 

Many different Societies may exist inside the Community and they have a matching Territorial presence, it's possible to envision a Community completely without Social Borders, as a system that reduces itself to one Society. Societies may also nest one on another, such as a country contain states and states contain cities. 

Since it has Territorial presence, it will have to deal with its environment and External elements.

## The Contract
The goal of a Contract is to provide a Product, either a Good or a Service. Products may be used as resources by other Contracts as well as consumed directly by the Community Members.

It has a two main components Resources Needed and Tasks Required. The Contract will also establish additional details regarding how much Product must be kept in stock if the concept is applicable, and minimum ammount of Resource needed for production.

Finally, Products have a Value, which needs to be provided so it can be used. This Value can be determined by the Weight of each Task and Resource needed. 

### Tasks
These are the Work Assignments in the Community, and the name represents two concepts, one is the Class, the set of shared characteristics and the other is the Instance, the specific demand for a task to be executed. Tasks define how much Value is awarded for an Hour of work, what is to be done, which Skills are required and details specific to it such as estimated effort and quality assurance. Specific instances will establish how much work is needed and when it needs to be done (including flexible ranges and also in some cases availability of Resources).

### Resources
Anything that isn't direct work is a Resource, even services provided by other DAOs. The important distinction comes to the most basic Resources, Natural Resources, such as Land, Water and so on. They are all managed by the Community, that establishes its Value and regulates its usage, all funds are collected by the Common Fund.

# The External World
While the rest of the World lives outside the Community, there must be a way for 1) accessing Resources owned by external agents; 2) allowing external agents to consume Products offered by the Community. 
The initial plan is for mostly regulate it through the Common Fund, but not in a direct Value exchange way as to not incentivize Workers to evade funds for individual profit. Since most items and services offered by the Community exist outside, the price practiced for Aliens would be to use the price of competitors in the external market, and since the purchase of external Resources is only allowed inside the context of a DAO, the Common Fund deals with the transaction.

## Technical Specification

Alright, How? By the usage of Contracts and DAOs its awful clear that this has something to do with Blockchain. Yes, that is correct, but right now I have no idea on how to make that happen ... well, I have some ideas, but very little practice on the tech and some stuff may be increadibly hard to impractical to do on Blockchains.

Also, there are a few UIs needed for interaction with the system, and some really good WitchCraft to make a decent Contract/Task modeller for non-tech folks to be able to break down Economic segments into DAOs and Contracts. Also, weareables and other small devices are great for simplifying some of the interactions described.

There is no need for this to run on an existing CryptoCoin, it could certainly operate on a different coin in a more closed system, the Common Fund also operating as the Reserve and giving monetary foundation to the Community. Also, Mining is not technically needed, neither is Proof of Work, the most important trait of the Blockchain is the Consensus Mechanism and if some low energy alternative is available, it should be considered.

There is no need for this to run Universally from day one, it can be built to work on premise, and the design allows for easy merging of communities.
